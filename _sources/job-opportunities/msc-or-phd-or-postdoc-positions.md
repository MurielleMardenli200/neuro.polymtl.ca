# MSc \| PhD \| PostDoc Positions

At the NeuroPoly lab at Polytechnique & Universit√© de Montr√©al \(www.neuro.polymtl.ca\), best student-city in the world! \([https://www.topuniversities.com/city-rankings/2017](https://www.topuniversities.com/city-rankings/2017)\), we develop advanced MRI image analysis techniques using deep learning and distribute them as open-source software. In collaboration with neuroradiologists and world experts in deep learning \(Mila\), we apply these tools in patients with traumatic injury and neurodegenative diseases \(multiple sclerosis, ALS, etc.\).

We are recruiting Master/PhD students and Postdoc fellows to work on various projects:

  * Skills: Image analysis \| Neuroimaging tools \| Programming \| git/GitHub
  * Related to: [Spinal Cord Toolbox](https://spinalcordtoolbox.com/)

## MRI Physics projects üß≤

`mri` | `physics` | `rf coils` | `shimming` | `biophysical modeling`

### Realtime shimming with MRI
 
* **Description**: Building on our recent progress on integrated shim coils and real time shimming technology, we are recruiting Master/PhD/Postdoc fellows to work on real time shimming projects applied to the spinal cord at 7T. Research will be conducted at the NeuroPoly lab \(Polytechnique, University of Montreal, [www.neuro.polymtl.ca](http://www.neuro.polymtl.ca/)\), and at the Montreal Neurological Institute \(MNI, McGill University\).
* **Skills**: Ultra-high field MRI | MRI acquisition | Image analysis
* **Related projects**: [Shimming Toolbox](https://shimming-toolbox.org/)
* **More** details [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/exfteqe66sado2y/20190511_PositionRealTimeShimming.pdf?dl=0)
* **Contact**: [Julien Cohen-Adad](mailto:jcohen@polymtl.ca)

### Vendor-agnostic realtime shimming

* **Description**: Shimming is a procedure that aims at homogeneizing the static (B0) magnetic field in an MRI scanner. When subjects breath, the B0 fields varies in time and space. Our group has developed methods to mitigate these variations, using external coils. However, it would be nice to be able to do it using the internal gradient and shim coils from the MRI system itself. One difficulty is that a lot of code and access to the hardware on these proprietary systems are restricted. A solution would be to use an RTHawk system, which offers full modularity when driving the MRI system.
* **Skills**: Physics |¬†Familiar with MRI | Computer programming |¬†System integration |¬†Experimentation | Image analysis
* **Related projects**: [Shimming Toolbox](https://shimming-toolbox.org/), [RTHawk environment](https://zenodo.org/record/3675442#.YakntPHMLkE)
* **Contact**: [Julien Cohen-Adad](mailto:jcohen@polymtl.ca)
