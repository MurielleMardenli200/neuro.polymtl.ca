"**Description:** Most deep learning segmentation methods work for a "
"specific data domain (eg: hospital, acquisition parameters, patient "
"demographics). This strongly limits the dissemination of advanced "
"solutions across various clinical and research centers. Some solutions, "
"such as transfer learning, require the user to train a model, which is "
"not realistic in a \"real world\" clinical scenario, where clinicians "
"neither have the time nor the expertise to train models that work for "
"their datasets. The goal of this project is to find solutions to make "

"**Description**: To obtain a nice image inside the body, an MRI device "
"assumes that the main magnetic field (B0) is homogeneous and stable over "
"time. Unfortunately (or fortunately for the subject), subjects breathe "
"while in the scanner. When subjects breathe, the B0 field varies in time "
"and space. The NeuroPoly laboratory, in collaboration with Dr. Stockmann "
"(Harvard/MIT), has developed hardware and software methods to compensate "
"for these variations. The principle is based on the development of so-"
"called \"shim\" coils, in which a direct current circulates, generating a"
" magnetic field (Biot-Savart law) which compensates for the "
"inhomogeneities of the B0 field. To orchestrate these complex "
"experiments, the NeuroPoly laboratory has also developed free software: "
"https://shimming-toolbox.org. We recruit Master/PhD/Postdoc students to "
"work on real-time shimming projects. Examples of projects: implementation"
" of optimization methods to find the right shim current combinations for "
"each coil element (taking into account physical constraints, such as the "
"maximum allowed current and dB/dt), experimentation with human subjects "
"at 3T and 7T (taking measurements, image analysis), comparison and "
"implementation of robust methods to map the B0 field, dynamic and real-"
