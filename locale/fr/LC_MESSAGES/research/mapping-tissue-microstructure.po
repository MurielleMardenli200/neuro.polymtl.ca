"Realistic tissue model for simulating the q-space diffusion MR signal. "
"The tissue model shown on the left was based on real histological data "
"and represents five different fibre calibre distributions for five "
"different regions of the human corpus callosum. Shown is a simulation for"
" one region \\(zoomed cube including fibres\\). The simulation software "
"enables us to choose a distribution of axon diameter, density, "
"orientation and myelin thickness. Here we set realistic values from "
"histology. The right panel shows a simulated MR signal given a set of "
"q-space acquisition parameters, e.g., the diffusion time \\(Δ\\) and the "
"maximum gradient strength \\(Gmax\\)."

"The myelin g-ratio \\(defined as the ratio of the inner to the outer "

"property of white matter that enables fast conduction of information. "
"Variations in the g-ratio have been reported in histological studies of "
"brain development and disease, but measuring it non-invasively in a "
"living human being is a major challenge. Above is a white matter model "
"that helps us define and compute the myelin g-ratio. This model allows us"
" to extract microstructural information on a scale much smaller than the "
"native MRI resolution. It assumes uniformity across the voxel of interest"
" \\(much like the rest of quantitative MRI\\), and defines aggregate "
"measures of the axon volume fraction, myelin volume fraction, fiber "
"volume fraction, and the g-ratio."
