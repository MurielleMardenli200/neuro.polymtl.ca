"Dr. Nikola Stikov is associate professor of biomedical engineering, a "
"researcher at the Montreal Heart Institute, and co-director of NeuroPoly,"
" the Neuroimaging Research Laboratory at École Polytechnique, University "
"of Montreal. His research runs the gamut of quantitative magnetic "
"resonance imaging, from basic issues of standardization and accuracy, to "
"biophysical modelling, microstructural imaging and clinical applications."
" His group is particularly interested in developing and validating novel "
"biomarkers for non-invasive characterization of the brain and heart "
"microstructure during development, disease and treatment, thus pushing "
"the boundaries of the emerging field of in vivo histology."

"Prior to joining the Polytechnique faculty, Dr. Stikov completed his "
"postdoctoral training with Dr. Bruce Pike at the Montreal Neurological "
"Institute, and his Ph.D. degree with Dr. John Pauly and Dr. Dwight "
"Nishimura at Stanford University. For his accomplishments, Dr. Stikov has"
" been awarded the Stanford Electrical Engineering Outstanding Service "
"Award in 2003, and the Stanford University Centennial Teaching Assistant "
"Award in 2007. He is also the founder of "
"[MRBalkan.org](http://www.mrbalkan.org), and has organized several "
"international conferences for magnetic resonance imaging under the "
"auspices of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine "
"\\(ISMRM\\). In 2014 Dr. Stikov was elected Junior Fellow of the ISMRM, "
"and in 2015 he joined the Editorial Board of the journal Magnetic "
"Resonance in Medicine \\(MRM\\), spearheading the journal's "
"[Highlights](http://www.ismrm.org/mrm) initiative. Continuing with his "
"science outreach activities, in 2016 Dr. Stikov established the official "
"[blog](http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/blog) of the Organization for "
"Human Brain Mapping \\(OHBM\\) and in 2018 he became chair of the "
"communications committee of the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform "
"\\(CONP\\)."
