"Dr. Cohen-Adad completed his PhD in 2008 at the University of Montreal "
"and pursued a 3-year postdoctoral fellowship at the MGH Martinos Center "
"at Harvard University. He is now associate professor at [Polytechnique "
"Montreal](https://www.polymtl.ca/en/), director of the Neuroimaging "
"Research Laboratory at Polytechnique \\(NeuroPoly\\) and associate "
"director of the [Neuroimaging Functional Unit](https://unf-montreal.ca/) "
"at University of Montreal. Dr. Cohen-Adad has a background in MR physics "
"and software development. His research focuses on the development of "
"multi-parametric MRI techniques for quantifying microstructure in the "
"brain and spinal cord. These developments include MRI coils, acquisition "
"at ultra-high field \\(7 Tesla\\), quantitative techniques \\(diffusion "
"imaging, magnetization transfer, functional MRI\\) and image processing "
"software \\(multimodal registration, segmentation, motion correction\\). "
"His lab has created and maintains multiple open-source software packages "
"to process medical image data and control the MRI system remotely [more "
"details here](https://github.com/sponsors/neuropoly). In collaboration "
"with several international hospitals, he has been translating these "
"advanced MRI techniques for studying patients with spinal cord injury and"
" multiple sclerosis. He has published over 145 articles \\(see [Google "
"Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=6cAZ028AAAAJ&hl=en)\\),"
" edited [the first book on quantitative MRI of the spinal cord "
"\\(Elsevier\\)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780123969736) "
"and has organized several workshops at international conferences \\(OHBM,"
" ISMRM\\)."
